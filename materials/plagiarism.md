# Plagiarism Policy 🚫

Plagiarism is the act of copying or using someone else's work or ideas without proper citation or acknowledgment. Plagiarism is considered a serious academic offense and can result in penalties such as failing grades, suspension, or even expulsion. 😱

To avoid plagiarism, you must give credit to the original sources of information, ideas, or words that you use in your project report. You can do this by using quotation marks, paraphrasing, summarizing, or citing the sources using a standard format such as APA, MLA, or Chicago. 📚

# Turnitin Report 📄👍

Turnitin is a web-based service that checks your project report for plagiarism and provides a Similarity Report that shows the percentage of matching text with other sources. Turnitin also uses artificial intelligence to detect potential plagiarism that is not based on text similarity, such as paraphrasing, translation, or synthesis. This is called the AI plagiarism percentage and it should be zero for your project report. 🧠

To submit your project report to Turnitin, you need to enroll in the **Big Data Management** class using the following details:

- Class ID: **42052721**
- Enrollment Key: **mcds1123**

You can access Turnitin by clicking [here](https://www.turnitin.com/login_page.asp).

You are allowed to resubmit your project report up to three times and get immediate feedback from Turnitin. After the third attempt, you will have to wait 24 hours before you can resubmit and get a new Similarity Report. ⏳
