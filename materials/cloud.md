## Amazon Web Services (AWS):

### EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):
Scalable virtual servers for compute capacity.

### S3 (Simple Storage Service):
Object storage for a wide variety of data types.

### RDS (Relational Database Service):
Managed relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.

### Lambda:
Serverless computing service for running code without provisioning or managing servers.

### DynamoDB:
Fully managed NoSQL database service.

### Redshift:
Data warehousing for analytics and business intelligence.

### ECS (Elastic Container Service):
Container orchestration using Docker containers.

**Pros of AWS:**
- Broad range of services.
- Global infrastructure.

**Cons of AWS:**
- Complex pricing model.

## Microsoft Azure:

### Azure Virtual Machines:
Scalable computing for Windows and Linux.

### Azure Blob Storage:
